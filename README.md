**Objective:**<br>
COFI PowerPlay: Analyzing Global Energy Investments is to systematically analyze the distribution and trends of Chinese investments in renewable versus non-renewable energy projects in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries. By identifying these trends, the analysis aims to provide strategic insights that support sustainable development, enhance environmental sustainability, and promote economic stability in these regions. The findings will inform policymakers, investors, and stakeholders to optimize future investment strategies and policies, ensuring a balanced and sustainable energy portfolio for BRI countries.
